title:  Dove soap is magic for your business

Dove soap is softer on your hands because it is one quarter moisturizing liquid

Best product positioning and marketing slogan of all time.

Think about this elevator pitch. I think about it all the time.

In one line, you know the value proposition: Soap that is softer on your hands!

In one line, you know the differentiation: They are focused on being softer on your hands!

And, most importantly, they tell you the magic: BECAUSE IT IS ONE-QUARTER MOISTURIZING LIQUID.

Now every other soap that wants to get in the game has to deal with this question: does your soap contain moisturizing liquid? How much?

If you are a competitor, your answers can vary:

<ul>
	<li>Less than one-quarter: You are doomed</li>
	<li>More than one-quarter: Are you still technically soap? You are just playing Doveâ€™s game now! This is 3.5 minute abs!</li>
	<li>We use something else: This is possible. But man, Dove uses moisturizing liquid!</li>
</ul>

So simple, so crystal clear, so easy to sell. You need to be like this.
