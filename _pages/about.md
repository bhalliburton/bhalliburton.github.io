I did technology consulting for more than a decade, then became a product manager. I realize in retrospect that product manager and entrepreneur is a much better fit for me than consultant because I seek constant iterative validation and am too emotionally invested in the outcome.

If you are looking for a resume, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhalliburton/">LinkedIn</a> is probably the best place to visit.
